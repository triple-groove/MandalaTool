## Bar Array Generator
The Bar Array Generator is a tool that generates an array of bars along a sinusoidal curve. The bars are positioned evenly along the curve based on the specified number of bars and group length. The positions and rotations of the bars are calculated using numerical integration and the elliptic integral of the second kind.

## Mandala Tool
The Mandala Tool is an extension of the Bar Array Generator that allows you to create intricate mandala patterns by arranging multiple bar arrays in a circular formation. The tool provides options to control the number of arrays, circle width, bar count, group length, vertical scale, and bar dimensions.
